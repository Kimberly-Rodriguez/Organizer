## Tools

This application was built using datepicker widget `datepikcer()`, autocomplete widget `autocomplete()`, and interactivity like `sortable()` in order for the list of skills to reorganized and be sorted using drag-and-drop functionality. The following site : https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#placeholder was used to identify the right widgets for this mini-project sample.
